            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> being Accuſed by the Malicious <hi>Jews,</hi> and many grievous Complaints laid againſt him, ſaying, he was a <hi>Peſtilent Fellow, a Mover of Sedition</hi> [or Contention] And that before <hi>Felix,</hi> the Governour, and <hi>Agrippa</hi> the King; yet in this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle comforted himſelf, and thought himſelf happy in, that thoſe Noble Perſons gave him leave to ſpeak for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to make his <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Defence. And in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner do I think my ſelf happy, (Honoured Sir) in that I have the Benefit of my Pen, and the Preſs, to make my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt the loud out-crys, and heavy Clamours of this People; who have in Print expoſed me under as odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Names, as their Tongue can invent: And altho' my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt their cauſleſs Accuſations may not hold paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel with what that great Apoſtle made for himſelf, and his Chriſtian Profeſſion, which the <hi>Jews</hi> accounted Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: Yet have I adventured to ſpend ſome leiſurable hours, to ſet forth to the World ſome reaſons, why it is no Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie from the Chriſtian Faith, to ſeparate from the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be pleaſed therefore, That under your Name and Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage they may appear, as a Covert to vail their Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, for Defective they muſt needs be in many reſpects: Firſt, For that I am not endued with that Spirit the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had: Secondly, I am not Accompliſh'd with Parts and Learning, ſufficient to graple with ſuch Schollars as are ſome of the Chieftains of the <hi>Quakers:</hi> Thirdly, My

And Fourthly, My diſtance from the Preſs occaſions many Omitions and Miſtakes. Yet foraſmuch as when I firſt appear'd publick againſt their Errors in <hi>Anno</hi> 1682.

            <p>SInce there are none Recorded in holy Scripture, on whom the Holy Ghoſt conferr'd ſo Honourable a Character, as the <hi>Bereans</hi> of that Age; [In that they ſearched after truth Impartially, and when they found it, Embraced it readily; and for which they were juſtly accounted Noble:] Therefore it is, that to you the Progeny of that worthy Stock, and Noble <hi>Bereans</hi> of this Age, that I chuſe to Dedicate the enſuing Diſcourſe; and therefore I beg of you not to degenerate from the Example of your Progenitors; if you do, you are no longer true <hi>Bereans:</hi> And to ſuch I do not Deſign this work; if you do not, I may aſſure my ſelf of the juſtice of a fair Inquiry, and an equal Judgment.</p>
            <p>I remember the <hi>Athenians, June</hi> the 14th. <hi>1692.</hi> by their Tenth Queſtion, demanded of the <hi>Quakers</hi> where to find their <hi>Creed,</hi> or an Account of their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> Will you [ſaid they] Subſcribe to any of the three Creeds, <hi>Nicean; Athanaſian,</hi> or <hi>Apoſtolical?</hi> If not, Will you give us one of your own, that the World may know what to make of you.</p>
            <p>To this, I find <hi>Geo. Whitehead,</hi> and others, in their Anſwer, ſtiled, <hi>The Doting Athenians,</hi> &amp;c. ſaying, <hi>Come and ſee, come into the true Light and ſee, and you may find our Creed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now, leſt the way to find out their crooked <hi>Creed,</hi> which lies diſperſedly in their Pamphlets, ſhould prove too hard a Task for the ſearching <hi>Bereans,</hi> I thought it needful to lend them my hand; and that it may the more plainly appear, not to relate either to the <hi>Nicean, Athanaſian,</hi> or <hi>Apoſtolical Creeds;</hi> I think it neceſſary to recite the ſum of the <hi>Apoſtolical Creed,</hi> which includes the ſubſtance of the other two; and which is believed by all Chriſtians, whether called <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians, Presbyterians Independants,</hi> and <hi>Baptiſts;</hi> for when contraries meet, their diſagreement does the more manifeſtly appear. <hi>viz.</hi>

                        <l>Then I affirm, this is their <hi>Creed:</hi>

                  <p>I know of no better Method to adviſe to: And to uſe my ſelf, than what <hi>William Penn</hi> did once excellently; chaulk out; in his Book, ſtyled, <hi>A Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat againſt Popery,</hi> &amp;c. which is, firſt, to ſhew the <hi>Papiſts</hi> their Errors, as I have done the <hi>Quakers;</hi> next, to ſhew their double dealing, <hi>viz.</hi> one thing to the World, and are indeed another to themſelves, and their under Graduits; all which I have ſet forth as the practice of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and lastly, call them to recant, and condemn them to their errors, before he will either take their words, for what they ſay, or trouble himſelf more with them, whoſe Methods I purpoſe to take; pray here <hi>W. Penn</hi> to (his late Friends,) the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> p, <hi>5. Tho' to argue againſt a Tribe of Men, who eſteem all reaſon carnal, and Scripture imperfect, might rightly be judged a meer beating the Air.— Yet, to prevent thoſe who may be deceived, and if poſſibly to reclaim ſuch as are; and laſtly, to clear my own conſcience, moſt of all in my Eye,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:102281:8"/>
                  <p>Now, how far my old Friends, the <hi>Quakers,</hi> reſemhle <hi>Will. Penn</hi>'s late Friends, the Papiſts, in accounting both Scripture and Reaſon, both Carnal and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, I leave to the Judgment of all Christians, who ſhall read their <hi>Creed,</hi> and other paſſages in this Treatiſe, which I have fairly quoted, and kept to the ſence of what they write. Again, <hi>p. 3.</hi> of his <hi>Caveat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They are grown ſo compliſant, as none ſeem more exaſperated at Perſecution, than themſelves <hi>[whileſt the very Fathers of it]</hi> decrying the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome Countreys, <hi>[whoſe Incendiaries they were, and ſtill are.]</hi> Nay for all their venerable eſteem of the Pope's Infallability, they have not ſtuck to cenſure his roaring</hi> Bulls <hi>[though procured by their own means:] <hi>That many unacquainted with their practices, are ready to believe them what they ſay themſelves to be; whoſe Morral is, to have two ſtrings to their</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, As this was a moſt grand piece of Hypocriſie in <hi>W.

To conclude, If we would not receive a Thief until he has Repented; let the</hi> Papiſts (<hi>yea, and</hi> Quakers <hi>too) firſt recant his volumnious Errors, not known in Scriptures; nor ever heard of for 300 (nay, reſpecting the</hi> Quakers, <hi>we may ſay 1600) Years together after Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And altho' I do not approve of all <hi>W. Penn</hi> hath writ (who ſometimes have writ againſt Popery ſo warmly, as no Man did exceed him; yet when 'twas like to be Rampant here, his Applauſe thereof was too apparent) yet in this caſe, I like his method, and do intend to abide by it.</p>

            <p>And for more of this ſee my Book Intituled, <hi>Reaſon againſt Railing, and Truth againſt Falſhood;</hi> Being a Concluſive Poſcript to my Book <hi>The Painted Harlot, &amp;c.</hi> Wrot <hi>1683,</hi> which is this day, as hardy as they are, they have not Anſwered. I ſay, theſe with divers other Books wrote by my ſelf, <hi>Thomas Criſp. W.

            <p>And therefore, Good <hi>Reader,</hi> if thou wilt Examine our Doings, I beſeech thee, To ſearch and prove what hath been wrote on both ſides, and judge uprightly, and do not ſuffer thy ſelf by ſhews and ſhifts to be beguiled; for what man will ſeem to deal ſo plainly as a <hi>Juggler;</hi> he will ſtroke up his Sleeves, and make bare his Arms, and open his Hands and Fingers, and lay all things before thee, and bid thee behold, and then thou will think him to be a good plain Man, and marvel thou ſhouldeſt poſſibly be Deceived, and yet indeed his whole Skill and Deſign is nothing elſe, but to deceive thee and the more ſimply and plainly he would ſeem to deal, ſo much the ſooner he will deceive thee; otherwiſe he were no <hi>Jugglar:</hi> Thou ſhalt think thou ſeeſt all, and yet ſeeſt nothing: then thou ſhalt think thou feelest it ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly with thy fingers; that thou holdeſt it faſt, and canſt not looſe it; and yet ſhalt open thy hands and find notheng, ſo eaſie a thing it is to enveagle thy ſences.</p>
            <p>Tell <hi>Geo. Whitehead,</hi> that 'tis a piece of Hypocryſie to pretend, that it is not Lawful to fight, and to make his Diſciples believe ſo, and yet at the ſame time incourage <hi>O. Cromwel</hi> his Army, and <hi>Officers</hi> to Fight, ſaying, <q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>Oh,</hi> Oliver Cromwel! <hi>Thou ſhouldſt have Invited all Nations upon Earth that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Popery. <hi>to come in and joyn with thee againſt</hi> Popery, Let thy Soldiers go forth with a free willing Heart, that thou mayſt Rock Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as a Cradle. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> I have choſen thee, <hi>O Cromwell</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I ſay, Is not this Great Hypocriſie to make their People believe that Fighting is unlawful for Chriſtians, and yet at the ſame time to Exhort, Excite, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage <hi>Oliver,</hi> his <hi>Army</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> to Fight, and not to leave off till they had ſet up their Standard at the Gates af <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>Again, VVhen the Author of the Book, <hi>The Qua. Volumn, &amp;c.</hi> recits part of their own Declaration, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q rend="margQuotes">We have choſen the Son of God to be our King, and he hath choſen us to be his People, and he might command Thouſands, and Ten Thouſand of his Servants at <hi>this day</hi> to Fight in his Cauſe

                  <hi>He</hi> might lead them forth and bring them in, and give them Victory over all their Enemies, and turn <hi>His Hand</hi> upon their Perſecutors, neither can we <hi>yet</hi> believe that <hi>He</hi> will make uſe of us in that way: Tho it be his only Right to Rule in all Nations, and our Heirſhip to Poſſeſs the utmoſt parts of the Earth, but for the <hi>preſent</hi> we are given up to bear and ſuffer all things for <hi>His Name ſake.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Which is a plain Demonſtration, that when they gave forth that Declaration, they did not know but <hi>God</hi> would make uſe of them in that way, though they did not <hi>as yet</hi> believe <hi>he</hi> would, but that for the <hi>Preſent</hi> they were given up to ſuffer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh, but ſays, <hi>G.

            </p>
            <p>Well might <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſay, <hi>Woe be to you Scribes and Phariſes, and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, which ſtrain at a</hi> Gnat <hi>and ſwallow a</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miel:<note place="margin">Mat. 23.</note> For they have taught their People to be ſo ſtiff and Stout<note n="*" place="margin">I once was one of them, but I thank God I am eſcaped their Snar, and perceive their <hi>Juggles;</hi> and do now abhor their deep Hypocriſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>, as that they will not pay their Aſſeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Trained Soldiers, and that under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that it is not lawful to uſe, nor yet to contribute towards the uſe of a Carnal Weapon: And yet at the ſame time they have, and can pay to the <hi>Royal Aide, Tax,</hi> and that of carrying on the War against the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and carrying on the War againſt the <hi>French:</hi> As if it was not as great an evil, to pay towards an actual Offenſive War, as to pay towards the ſending out our Trained Solders for the Defence of our Nation.</p>
            <p>Not granting either to be an evil when there is juſt cauſe for it. But I mention this to ſhew how our <hi>Phariſes Strains at a Gnat and Swallows a Camiel.</hi> For of the Two an Offenſive War is not ſo neceſſary as a Defenſive War.</p>
            <p>Good <hi>Reader,</hi> Theſe are the People that exalt themſelves above all other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors whatever, reckoning all ſave themſelves to be of the World, out of the <hi>Truth, Heathens, Apoſtates,</hi> and without the <hi>Poale</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the <hi>only</hi> People of God; and that they, and they <hi>only</hi> are in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and for diſtinguiſhing themſelves from others, they have taken up ſome ſingular Obſervations; as, ſaying <hi>thou</hi> not <hi>you</hi> to a ſingle Perſon, calling no Man Mr. but <hi>John, Thomas, William, &amp;c.</hi> and the like, not that I thank you for any kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but <hi>I receive thy Love;</hi> not carrying the <hi>Feet</hi> but the <hi>Head</hi> foremoſt of their Dead; they condemn the Courteſie of putting of the <hi>Hatt,</hi> to any others, though of their <hi>Apprentices</hi> they exact it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<note n="*" place="margin">This Piece of Hypocriſie, I teſtifyed againſt more then 16 Years ſince (which was before <hi>S.

In ſhort, they affected ſingularity in moſt things that are Cuſtomary in <hi>England;</hi> how Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſoever, now I would ask my <hi>Reader,</hi> what of
<pb facs="tcp:102281:14"/> real Vertue or ſingular Goodneſs is in theſe things; ſuppoſe the whole world did obſerve them, would they be at all the better for it? However by theſe things they have cut off all others, how Religious and Sincere ſoever. Read the <hi>Quakers Unmasked, &amp;c. p. 26.</hi> And there you ſhall ſee, that their great Prophet <hi>G. Fox,</hi> believed himſelf to be in a State beyond the <hi>Firſt Adam</hi> that fell, and in the State of the <hi>Second Adam</hi> that never fell; that his very Marriage was above the State of the <hi>Firſt Adam</hi> in his Innocency: In the State of the <hi>Second Adam</hi> that never fell, and that he never fell nor changed. That he had Power to <hi>bind</hi> and <hi>looſe</hi> whom he pleaſed, and much to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The next thing I ſhall obſerve to the <hi>Reader</hi> is, whereas they have often Called, Printed, and Expoſed me, <hi>a Contentious Apoſtate, a Self condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Apoſtate, &amp;c.</hi> That I have endeavoured to avoid Contention, and that I am not what they repreſent me, I muſt devide theſe Two charges, <hi>viz. Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from a Self condemned Perſon,</hi> which laſt I Reſerve to ſpeak more fully to in the body of the Book, ſince 'tis only a finer and ſofter word for a Heretick; and therefore though at preſent they have not power to do much miſchief, yet they have <hi>Malice,</hi> they have <hi>Envy,</hi> they have <hi>Falſe Gloſſings,</hi> they have the Art of <hi>Forgery;</hi> they can Invert, Pervert, VVreſt, Amuſe, and Abuſe their <hi>Reader:</hi> And by keeping behind the Curtain they can miſlead wiſe Men, for they have their Evaſions; their Equivocations, their Mental Reſervations, <hi>viz.</hi> Only let forth ſo much at a time, as that the unwary <hi>Reader</hi> would take them to be plain, ſimple and well meaning; and that they had no Skill in the Art of <hi>Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling.</hi> But if you mark well what I ſay, you ſhall find that they can pretend to meet to Diſpute their Oppoſers, Prieſts or Profeſſors; and for that Reaſon too, that Truth may be manifeſt, and Error denyed; diſowned and rejected; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold they mean no ſuch thing, it is far from their Intention, as <hi>anon</hi> will appear they can call all the Doctors and Schollers in <hi>Europe</hi> out of their <hi>Holes, Dens, &amp;c.</hi> As if they themſelves were ready to come forth into the Field with their Slings and Stones and Bags; but alas, tis but like the <hi>Jugglers</hi> ſtriking up his Sleeves, and making bare his Arms. And the like I ſay, tis what they never mean, for 'tis impoſſible to get them out of their <hi>Holes, Dens,</hi> and <hi>Lurking places,</hi> where they lye Skulking to deceive the People: Thus <hi>Reader,</hi> you ſee they have got the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Tools, and Implements, I know of nothing wanting but the Law on their Side; and therefore, I am concerned to Vindicate my Chriſtian Reputation from their Malitious Charge of <hi>Self condemned Apoſtate,</hi> and with <hi>Dr. Martin Luther</hi> ſay,<note place="margin">See <hi>M.

            <p>Now <hi>Reader,</hi> what could be ſaid more, what could be ſaid plainer, and to ones thinking, we have them faſt enough, but behold all this is to deceive, and Inveagle thee into a belief of their Simplicity, Plainneſs, and Integrity, when alas, they mean nothing ſo! they deſign no ſuch Plainneſs, 'tis but a Sham, a Trick to dazle thy Eyes and to deceive thee; and this I ſhall prove to their ſhames, <hi>viz.</hi> I took certain of their Principles in Print, out of their Books. And upon the <hi>22th.</hi> of <hi>November 1691</hi> carried them with an Abſtract of the recited Epiſtle, to their Publick Meeting; and there Read the Charge, Read my Challange <hi>In</hi> the words of their own Propoſition, to the intent that if they would have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered my Challange and Diſpute the Points according to their ſaid Propoſition in their Epiſtle, the world ſhould never have ſeen them; by all which 'tis plain that I have not been Contentious in the ſenſe <hi>G.

            <p>I Remember that when their Predeceſſors the <hi>Papiſts</hi> charged Dr. <hi>Barns</hi> the Martyr with Apoſtacy, Blaſphemy, and many other Crimes, he offered the <hi>Popiſh Biſhops</hi> this fair Propoſal, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>And as this was his caſe; ſo have I found ſomething of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Geo. Whitehead, Sam.

Then in my Book, <hi>The Quakers Detected, &amp;c.</hi> I made them alſo aſhamed of ſuch <hi>Billingſgate</hi>-Language. And now the Crime they would fix upon me, is, <hi>An Apoſtate, A ſelf-condemned Apoſtate, An Apparent Apoſtate,</hi> which are the worſt of Names; and had they power to their Wills, I might juſtly fear the Fate which others met with from their Predeceſſors, the envious Papiſts.

            </p>
            <p>I have read of M. <hi>Luther's</hi> Reſolution, Zeal, and Chriſtian Courage againſt the Pope and his pretended Infalibility, and other holy Cheats, (ſaith the Historian) <hi>He charged the Pope not with Life, but with Learning; not with his Doings, but with his Doctrine; not picking at the Rine, but plucking at the Root; not ſeeking the man, but ſhaking the Kingdom; yea, and charging him with plain Hereſie.— And ſtill urging and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing things to the Foundation and Touchſtone of the Scriptures,</hi>

               <hi>opened the Eyes of many,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>How far my weak endeavours may be ſaid to bear the ſame Complexion with Reſpect to this People, I will not determine; but this I am ſenſible of, there is as much need now to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask their Leaders, and to let their Hearers ſee their crafty Jugglings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they miſlead them, as there was in the days of <hi>Luther;</hi> and under a ſenſe thereof, I am willing to lay out my Talent, aſſuredly believing, that though what I now write, may not prevail with their preſent Infatuated Diſciples, yet both in this Age, and Ages to come; It will be a means to prevail upon the examining <hi>Bereans,</hi> even ſuch as will ſearch the Scriptures, whether what they hold and teach be according to them, yea or nay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But 'tis objected by <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> in his Third Charge in his Book, ſtiled, <hi>The Conten. Apoſtate recharged,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p. 5, 6. That</hi> Francis Bugg <hi>is neither Conſcienciouſly a Religious nor Ingenuous in his writing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for that he makes no conſcience of writing malicious Lyes, notorious odious Forgeries and Slanders to villifie and defame others,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And for particular inſtances to evince his charge, he cites ſometimes four words in a line, then skips to another part of a line; taking a bit here, and a bit there, without the leaſt demonſtration or Convincing Argument.</p>
            <p>Thus he jumpeth and leapeth this way and that way, floating as a Ship with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Helm or Anchor, ſtill ſhewing himſelf like the <hi>Papiſts</hi> great Champion.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> againſt Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> as you may read in the Preface to the <hi>Defence of the Apology of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where Mr. <hi>Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> ſaith: Mr. <hi>Jewell is the open Enemy of the Church; Mr.</hi> Jewell <hi>is worſe than</hi> Ananias, <hi>that condemned St.</hi> Paul; <hi>Mr.</hi> Jewell <hi>playeth the part of</hi> Antichriſt, <hi>Mr.</hi> Jewell <hi>is proud; Mr.</hi> Jewell <hi>is</hi> Lucifer, <hi>and ſerves the Devil; Mr.</hi> Jewell <hi>is a Forger, Mr.</hi> Jewell <hi>is a Lyer, an Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Lyer: Mr.</hi> Jewell <hi>moſt falſly corrupteth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But as I believe, Mr. <hi>Jewell</hi> was clear of the Papiſts foul Charges; So have I been very careful not to miſ-repreſent theſe People, or their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, much leſs to forge a Lye, (a thing I abhor) for truth is plain, and hath no need of ſuch wicked acts to uphold it; and therefore good Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, peruſe what is writ on both ſides, endeavour to know the cauſe thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and then judge uprightly.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:102281:17"/>
            <p>And if after a thorow Examination, thou doſt not find that they pretend to have a Spirit beyond the Fore-Fathers, and thereby know who are Saints, who are Devils, and who are Apoſtates, and that none need to give them diſcerning, or Judgment, but that by vertue of this extraordinary Spirit, they pretend that <hi>on all</hi> occaſions, and <hi>at all times</hi> they are ſufficiently furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then I have wronged them, and miſ repreſented them which would indeed be both diſingenuous, and unconſcionable. But if they do thus pretend, and ſet theſe things out as their principles in print, (and thereby deceive the ſimple, and by vertue thereof, and of the like prodigious errors) then I think it my duty, publickly to Reprove them, when all private means will not reclaim them.</p>
            <p>Again, If after a thorow Examination, thou findeſt that they deny the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon of the Trinity; that they do not own Him that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſate upon <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Well, that was ſpit upon, ſmote with the Palms of their Hands, thruſt a Spear into his Side; hanged on the Tree, wrapt in the Linnen Cloths, Died, was Buried, and roſe again the third day, to be the <hi>Chriſt</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> Then wilt thou ſee it high time for a Teſtimony to be born againſt ſuch falſe and erroneous Doctrine, and dangerous Principles, which are Pernitious to the very Foundation of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion.</p>
            <p>Again, If upon a thorow Examination thou ſhalt find that they ſet it forth in print as their principle; that the Name <hi>Chriſt</hi> belongs to every Believer <hi>as well</hi> as to <hi>him,</hi> that was born of the Virgin, as aforeſaid. Then wilt thou find <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s words fulfilled, who ſaid, <hi>Mat. 24.5. Many ſhall come in my Name, ſaying, I am Chriſt, and ſhall deceive many, &amp;c.</hi> I ſay when thou ſeeſt this their erroneous Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and conſiders that they reckon none Believers but themſelves, thou wilt begin to ſee a neceſſity for a Teſtimony to be born againſt them, tho' they rail and rave, becauſe thereof, like their Predeceſſor Mr. <hi>Harding:</hi> I ſay, when theſe erroneous Principles, and the Conſequences of them come to thy view, thou mayeſt then conſider, whether I have been vainly conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, yea or nay.</p>
            <p>I know, if thou wilt obſerve <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> and his Brethrens Advice, they would (like their <hi>Elder Siſter</hi>) have thee Read but one ſide, burn and conſume ſuch Books as rip up their Errors, for Errour loves obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; they would have you believe as the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> as <hi>they</hi> believe, without any farther Examination, and to pin your Faith on their Sleeves: But if you obey, then know, that you are upon the Borders of <hi>Rome;</hi> let their pretences for their direction, and yours for your blind Obedience be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo fairly gilded, and curiouſly painted.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:102281:18"/>
            <p>And therefore, I beſeech thee, and that for thy Souls ſake; ſearch thou the Scriptures, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> biddeth thee: Learn to know the Will of <hi>God,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf adviſeth thee; have pleaſure in <hi>God's</hi> holy Word, as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> warneth thee, and thou ſhalt never be deceived: But be able to try all things, and inclined to hold faſt that which is good: Which, that we may all do, is the Deſire and Prayer of thy Faithful Monitor.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Shewing that the forſaking the <hi>Quakers</hi> is no Apoſtacy from the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith.</head>
               <p>BEfore I proceed to ſhew the dangerous Conſequences which theſe erronious Principles produce, as in the firſt Chapter ſet forth, I may ſpeak ſomething to their uncharitable ſenſure of me, calling me an <hi>Apoſtate;</hi> but had they left off there, I could have born it, becauſe 'tis not equal with Hereſie; and ſomething muſt be born by any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that hath to do with them; but when I ſee by their laſt two Books, that they expoſe me to the World, <hi>a ſelf condemned Apoſtate, an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Apoſtate, a contentious Apoſtate, &amp;c.</hi> with all the aggravating Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which they could poſſibly invent, and all this publick; beſides ſeveral private Letters ſent me by Poſt, both in Verſe and Proſe, as full of curſing Language as <hi>Muggleton</hi> could have filled them withal, calling me <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> the Apoſtate,<note n="*" place="margin">Which are ſaid to be <hi>Stephen Criſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Well, however to juſtifie my ſelf from this their ſenſure of Hereſie, or ſelf condemned Apoſtate, I would premiſe to the Reader, that according to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> every Error doth not make a Man an Heretick, or a ſelf condemned Apoſtate, for ſays he, <hi>errare poſſum hereticus, eſſe non poſſum:</hi>

                  <p>

                  <hi>Reader,</hi> I have tranſcribed the more of this former Book of mine, Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>The Quakers detected, and their Errors confuted,</hi> &amp;c. by reaſon <hi>George
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102281:24"/> Whitehead,</hi> in his Book, ſtyled, <hi>The Contentious Apoſtate,</hi> &amp;c. recites the firſt Point then under Conſideration, which was, <hi>How I came to be a Member of their Society?</hi> But the ſecond Point under Conſideration, which was, <hi>How I came to ſee and perceive their Apoſtacy, and leave them?</hi> And the third Point under Conſideration, which was, <hi>How, and by what means I came to have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in going to the Publick? I</hi> ſay, theſe two laſt Points <hi>G. W.</hi> takes no notice of: For <hi>I</hi> having in the firſt Point acknowledged what <hi>I</hi> then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, he repreſents it, as if <hi>I</hi> was of the ſame Judgment when <hi>I</hi> went to the Publick; for if that be not his intent, he ſpeaks in the Air, and to no purpoſe: Now if <hi>I</hi> at the time of my going to Church, was in the belief that the <hi>Quakers</hi> were in the true Faith, true Worſhip, ſpiritual Teſtimony attended with that Simplicity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which <hi>I</hi> in 86. thought them to be in, as <hi>I</hi> did in 1660, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then I grant I had gone ſelf-condemned, becauſe I had acted contrary to my belief: But to anſwer that, ſo long as I had thoſe thoughts, I kept to them; nay longer: But when I went to the publick, that part of my Book now recited, ſhews my mind ſufficiently, and my judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them; to which I refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Well, but ſtill</hi> George <hi>ſeems to object, that I did once own them to have been the true Church, and therefore to leave them is SELF-CONDEMNED APOSTACY.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I marvel <hi>G. W.</hi> ſhould think that to be Apoſtacy; for if that be ſound Arguing, then I will prove moſt of the Ancient Quakers ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Apoſtates; ſince they have ſeparated from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or ſome other Proteſtant Churches, which they once owned to be a true Church: And to confirm this my opinion and judgment, I will produce a good Author in my Eſteem (whatever he be in <hi>G. W.</hi>'s) and that is Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> that Innocent Martyr whoſe life is worthy to be had in Imitation by all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, for he was the principal Inſtrument un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>GOD</hi> and the King, that threw off the Popes yoke of Supremacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Come, <hi>George,</hi> I think it is eaſie to clear my ſelf from this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma, and to eſcape your Snare; for tho I thought well of you in the beginning, yet you abuſe your Reader, to make him believe and think <hi>I</hi> thought ſo well of you in 86; No, far was ſuch a thing from me,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Viz.</hi> The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Detected, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> as may very well be ſeen by what <hi>I</hi> have herein incerted of <hi>THAT</hi> Book which you boaſt ſo much of for my Teſtimony of you. <hi>INDEED, I</hi> muſt ſay, <hi>I</hi> had in 86. better thoughts of you, with reſpect to your beginning, than <hi>I</hi> now have; and if by reaſon of them good thoughts <hi>I</hi> had of you, <hi>I</hi> was in an Error, as if it will do you any good, <hi>I</hi> will tell you <hi>I</hi> was; yet this doth not render me an <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> for if ſo, you will make all the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and Proteſtants that had ever any good thnughts of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church <hi>APOSTATES,</hi> then you will be <hi>Rome</hi> indeed, and ſhe ought to give you the right hand of Fellowſhip. But <hi>I</hi> would hope you are not gotten ſo far as yet, tho <hi>I</hi> think you are marching on apace; for ſhe accounts all Apoſtates and Hereticks that are not of her Faith.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:102281:25"/>
               <p>And truly you do little leſs, in that you charge me to be <hi>A SELF-CONDEMNED APOSTATE:</hi> for that I gave my charitable opinion of you in the beginning. If you were not what you then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be, as I now believe you were not, I was then the more miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and in the greater Error, all this I grant. But who was in the fault, you or I? I am ſure you ought to have been ſincere, humble and meek, as <hi>I</hi> took you to be; and the fault was yours, if you were not ſo; and the more you make People believe you to be what in reality you are not, the more you will have to anſwer for. And if <hi>I</hi> was in an Error in taking you to be what you were not, even ſo was <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> who was a zealous Fryer, who ſaid<note n="*" place="margin">Foxes <hi>Acts and Monum.</hi> p. 410.</note>, <hi>If the Lord refuſed not to have Teſtimony given against his Doctrine, how much more I, that am but vile Corruption, and can do nothing but err,</hi> &amp;c. Here you ſee that if <hi>I</hi> was in an Error, a better Man than either <hi>G. W.</hi> or <hi>F. B.</hi> does not think himſelf too good to own he was in an Error. And that it may ſtill appear that good Men have been miſtaken, in and by the cunning crafty Papiſts, as much as <hi>I</hi> was in your fair Pretences, and ſmooth <hi>DEMURE</hi> Carriage, as if you could not hurt a Worm, when the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Aſps was under your Tongue. <hi>I</hi> will produce one Inſtance more, and then proceed to ſhew more Reaſons why the forſaking you, is no Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy from the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I am <hi>(ſaid</hi> Hugh Latimer, <hi>that laborious Preacher, and bleſſed Martyr)</hi> Ignorant of things which I truſt hereafter to know as I do now know things: <note place="margin">Foxes <hi>Acts and Monum.</hi> p. 1325. Humility in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</note> In which I have been Ignorant heretofore; <hi>Ever learn, and ever to be learned;</hi> to profit with learning. I thought in times paſt that the Pope was Chriſts Vicar, had been Lord of all the World, as Chriſt is; ſo that if he ſhould have deprived the King of his Crown it had been enough, for he could do no wrong—Now I think otherwiſe, and I thought in time paſt, that, and if I had been a Fryer in a Coul, I could not have been damned, nor afraid of Death; and by occaſion of the ſame, I have been minded many times to have been a Fryer. Namely, when I was ſore ſick and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, and now I abhor my ſuperſtitious Fooliſhneſs — It were too long to tell you what blindneſs I have been in, and how long it were e're I could forſake ſuch Folly, and thus far, Humble <hi>Latimer</hi>;.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Come <hi>G. W.</hi> What do you think, was <hi>Hugh Latimer</hi> right, when he was amongſt the Papiſts, or right when he gave this plain Teſtimony againſt them? You will ſay, he could not be right then, if right now; but if right now, he could not be right then. Now I will not ſay, but he was in an error in being ſo zealous for rhe Popiſh way; but yet thus far I will venture to go on the Martyr's ſide, that he was right in his intention, and in Sincerity, when he was thus deluded by the crafty Frier's carriage; but they being ſo ſubtile and crafty, that we ſee this worthy-learned Preacher was carried away, <hi>viz. with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102281:25"/> pretended to preach <hi>FREELY,</hi> nnd pretended many fair things; but when <hi>Hugh Latimer</hi> once ſaw their Craft and Subtilty, and that there was nothing but Self-Ends, and Self-Righteouſneſs in the bottom, then he ſoon left them: But for his pains, they called him <hi>Heretick,</hi> and <hi>Self condemned Apoſtate, Contentious Apoſtate.</hi> And had this young Harlot power, <hi>I</hi> have reaſon to expect the ſame Fate.</p>
               <p>Come <hi>G.

But tho <hi>Joſiah Coals,</hi> &amp;c. Letters to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Superſtitious, but Blaſphemous, and Idolatrous, yet you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, juſtify, and ſay well done to ſuch Abominations.<note place="margin">See their 10th Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</note> You may alſo ſee, that tho theſe bleſſed Martyrs confeſſed that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> once taught ſound and pure Doctrine, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs did then commend their Practice, Converſation and Deportment, and accounted ſuch Doctrine ſo taught, a diſpenſation of the love of <hi>GOD</hi> to Mankind; yet when they ſaw that they Apoſtatized from theſe things, and began to impoſe <hi>Tranſubſtation,</hi> and other Novelties, as <hi>GOD's</hi> Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, you ſee they then forſook them, left them. And not only ſo, but did hear a full and ample Teſtimony againſt their Pride, their Haughtineſs, their infallible Pretentions, their grand Errors, and deep Hypocriſies; not always picking at the Rine, but ſtriking at the Root, until at laſt, what by diſputing, what by writing, what by printing, and with <hi>GOD's</hi> bleſſing upon their endeavours, the Pope's Authority in <hi>England</hi> quite expired. But oh what ſad Bawling the Pope and his Cardinals, Prieſts and Fryers, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits and Nuns, and all your Kindred made againſt <hi>Luther, Barns, Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague, John Huſs, Philip Melancthon,</hi> and the reſt of that noble, bleſſed, and for ever renowned Army, calling them <hi>Apoſtates, Self condemned Apoſtates, apparent Apoſtates, manifeſt Apoſtates, contentious Apoſtates,</hi> &amp;c. And having then the Law of their ſide, (which I thank <hi>GOD</hi> you have not) burnt many of them. Thus <hi>I</hi> hope you may ſee a lively Figure of your ſelves, and alſo that as <hi>I</hi> have acquitted my ſelf of that Dilemma which you dreamed you had caſt me into, <hi>I</hi> have left you with your Kindred in that Dilemma, which nothing but Repentance and Amendment will deliver you from which <hi>GOD</hi> of his mercy grant you may.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102281:26"/> confirm this my opinion, ſee <hi>Iſaack Peningtons</hi> one of their moſt learned, and knowing Writers (whoſe works they have taken care to reprint in <hi>Folio</hi>) who ſaith thus,<note place="margin">A Queſtion to the Profeſſors, <hi>p.</hi> 33.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, In that they never in their publick meetings, for worſhip of God, nor yet in their Families, make confeſſion of their ſins to God; asking pardon for <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> ſake. This is one reaſon to confirm their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that their Leaders deny Chriſt Jeſus, who was born of the Virgin, to be both Lord and Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In all their books you never yet found, that ever they confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Sins, and asked Pardon for Chriſt's ſake; whereby it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that as thereby they deny Chriſt as aforeſaid, ſo they render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of a ſingular Spirit to all the Prophets, Apoſtles, Saints, Martyrs, and Confeſſors ſince the world ſtood; as may be ſeen by the Scriptures in the Margin beginning, with <hi>Moſes Pſal.</hi> 90. to the very Martyrs. Yea,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.2, 3. Pſal. 90. Job 7.20. Lam. 3.41, 42. Iſa. 64.6. Dan. 4.9. to the end. 1 John 1.8. 1 Tim. 1.15.

They have a Spirit <hi>contrary</hi> to the Prophets, <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to the Apoſtles, <hi>contrary</hi> to the Ancient Fathers, and <hi>contrary</hi> to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Faith and Principle of the bleſſed Martyrs; but ſuch hath been the art of theſe Deluders, that as they have undervalued <hi>Chriſt,</hi> calling him <hi>a Garment, a Vail, a Figure,</hi> &amp;c. So have they undervalued the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, by calling them <hi>Carnal, Death, Duſt, the Serpents Food,</hi> and the like Antichriſtian names, as anon I ſhall ſhew; ſo that it will be hard to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102281:27"/> their Diſciples to read the Scriptures cited: And if they do, yet not to yield them that Authority, which <hi>G.W.</hi> gives to their ſpeaking by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit who ſays <hi>That which is ſpoken from the Spirit of Truth in any, is of as great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as the Scriptures and Chapters are, and greater,</hi> &amp;c. Ser <hi>Apoll. p.</hi> 49.</p>
               <p>Oh the conſequence of this monſtrous opinion! if <hi>HE</hi> that was born, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be not <hi>the Christ,</hi> but a <hi>Garment,</hi> a <hi>Vail,</hi> a <hi>Figure, &amp;c.</hi> Then why did not the Prophets foretell, that a Virgin ſhould conceive, and bring forth a Garment. That a Virgin ſhould conceive, and bring forth a Vail, a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh monſtrous! So that its no marvel that you do not pray in the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> beg pardon in the Name of Chriſt ſince you own Him only as a Garment which waxeth old, or as a Figure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But perhaps ſome of your own People may ſay, is it indeed ſuch a Chriſtian duty to make Confeſſion of our Sins to God, and to beg Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for Jeſus Chriſts ſake. If we indeed believed it a duty, we would (notwithſtanding the practice of our Teachers, who we know does not) practice the ſame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I hope then there is ſome ſuch <hi>Bereans</hi> ſtill left (how thin ſoever they be) amongſt you; and for their ſakes, in my book, <hi>The Quakers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, and their Errors confuted,</hi> &amp;c. I laid down many precepts, to which I refer you, as alſo to the Scriptures in the Margin; and if you read the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, you ſhall not read one book from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the <hi>Revelations,</hi> but you ſhall find ſome precept which may ſtrengthen you in this your duty.</p>
               <p>And that I may not leave this point without warrantable proof, I will add to the Teſtimony of the Prophets, and Practice of the Apoſtles, and the Precept of Chriſt, who has taught his Diſciples (and in them all that follow them, in the ſame Faith) to ſay, <hi>Forgive us our Sins,</hi> &amp;c. The Practice and Judgment of the bleſſed Martyrs; who unanimouſly, as a Cloud of Witneſſes, concur with the Judgment, and Practice of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chiſtians; And againſt the ſingular opinion, and ſingular practice of your Miniſters: who though they pretend, and make you believe, they have a Spirit <hi>beyond all the Forefathers,</hi> it is indeed, being rightly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, a Spirit <hi>contrary</hi> to all the Forefathers of the Chriſtian Race.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, hear Dr. <hi>Robert Barnes,</hi> viz. <hi>The whole Church prayeth,</hi> LORD <hi>forgive us our Sins;</hi>

                  <hi>wherefore ſhe hath ſpots and wrincles: But by acknowledging them (through the Merits of Chriſt) her wrincles be ſcratched out,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Next hear what <hi>Martin Luther</hi> ſays, touching this particular duty, <hi>viz. But thou wilt ſay the Church is Holy, the Fathers are Holy; it is true notwithſtanding,</hi>

                  <hi>albeit the Church is Holy, yet, is ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to pray, Forgive us our Treſpaſſes; ſo tho the Fathers are Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet are they ſaved through the Forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two have given joint Teſtimony, that 'tis the Churches Duty; nay, ſhe is compelled to confeſs, and beg pardon of her Sins.</p>

               <p>And now to finiſh this Chapter, I ſhall conclude in the words of Dr. <hi>Barnes,</hi> whoſe Faith in Chriſt does as much differ from the Faith of, and Principles of the Quakers, as Light from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.<note place="margin">See their 3d. and 4th.

                  <hi>whereby you ſhall perceive what erronious opinions I hold; and now hearken to my Faith, I believe in the Holy and Bleſſed Trinity,</hi>

                  <hi>that created and made all the world. I believe that without mans will or power Chriſt Jeſus was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, and took Fleſh of the Bleſſed Virgin</hi> Mary. <hi>That he ſuffered Thirſt, Hunger, Cold,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Which he could not do as he was God, but as he was man, <hi>viz.</hi> the man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Thus gentle Reader have I ſhewed that the Doctrine, Principles, Faith, and Practice of the Quakers, is <hi>contrary</hi> to the Doctrine, Principles, Faith, and Practice of the Apoſtles, Primitive Chriſtians, Saints, Martyrs, and Holy Confeſſors of the Catholick Faith from <hi>Moſes</hi> to this day; both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Humanity of Chriſt, and praying and confeſſing our Sins to God, and begging Pardon for Chriſts ſake, which is another reaſon, and a good one too, why the forſaking the Quakers is no Apoſtacy from the Chriſtian Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I Am now come to ſhew what they mean, when they talk of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, as by their books are manifeſt; and if they will not own their books, which they have ſaid are given forth by the immediate and eternal Spirit of <hi>GOD,</hi> then let them firſt condemn the books of <hi>Geo. Fox, Iſ. Pennington,</hi> and moſt of their eminent Writers; and declare themſelves fully that they are of another mind, and that they own Chriſt according to the Angels Teſtimony, and the Apoſtles and Martyrs Teſtimony; or elſe we ſhall conclude they are as erroneous as their books ſet forth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pray hear <hi>Iſ. Penington,</hi> in his book ſtiled, <hi>Queſt. to the Profeſſors,</hi> &amp;c. p. 27. <hi>viz. The Name Chriſt belongs to the whole Body, as well as to the HEAD, and to every Member of the Body: The Name is not given to the VESSEL, but to the NAT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE to the Heavenly TREAS<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE to that which is of Him in the Veſſel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now Reader mark what the conſequence of this blaſphemous Doctrine is, which ſays, that the Name <hi>CHRIST</hi> belongs to every Believer, as well and as amply as to <hi>CHRIST</hi> the Head, who is <hi>GOD</hi> bleſſed for evermore.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:102281:28"/>
               <p>Here you ſee the Conſequence, firſt of their not owning <hi>HIM</hi> that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to be the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (for if they cannot call <hi>HIM</hi> ſo, they cannot own <hi>HIM</hi> to be ſo,<note place="margin">See your 2d and 3d Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in the firſt Chapter of this Treatiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

And 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, in aſſuming to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Name, in that <hi>Chriſt</hi> the heavenly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is in them. Thus have they magnified themſelves equal with <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and I will prove that they thus mean, by the very words of their great Apoſtle <hi>G.

               </p>
               <p>Now then if it be ſo? as ſo they do believe it to be; for firſt they ſay, they have the eternal, infallible Spirit of <hi>GOD</hi> in them, from which they ſpeak, write, act, give forth their Orders for Womens Meetings<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <p>See my Book <hi>de Chr. Lib.</hi> &amp;c. from p. 36. to 72. where your whole Authority for your Womens Meeting is ſet down, and their Original, and all from <hi>G.

                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed <hi>John Fiddyman</hi> (a Quaker) did deny to have any other Spirit than what Chriſtians own in common; and, to give him his due, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to own <hi>G.

                  </note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then I do demand what hinders them from deſerving the Name <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as well as <hi>HE</hi> that was born of the Virgin, that ſuffered cold hunger, was ſmote with the palms of their hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſince they cannot call him <hi>Chriſt?</hi> I ſay, if they have the ſame Spirit, the ſame Treaſure in them, which raiſed up <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and are thereby <hi>equal with GOD,</hi> as they ſay they are. What hinders, but that we may have as many Chriſts, as Quakers? at leaſt, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as the Quakers have Preachers: For ſome of their Hearers, I do believe, are more modeſt, than to entertain theſe <hi>Luciferian</hi> thoughts, tho' indeed they do not know how far they are Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into this erroneous and pernicious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as I have by the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>

               <p>In the next place I am come to ſhew how they extol their own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and how they have thrown Contempt upon the Scriptures, and that alſo out of their own Books, which is a Conſequence of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Errors.</p>

               <p>In one of their Books<note n="*" place="margin">The Quakers Refuge fix'd on the Rock of Ages, <hi>p.</hi> 17.</note> they thus query, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q rend="margSglQuotes">Whether the firſt Penman of the Scriptures was <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Hermes?</hi> Or whether both theſe, or not one? Or whether there are not many words contained in the Scriptures which were not ſpoken by Inſpiration of the Holy Spirit? Whether ſome words were not ſpoken by the grand Impoſture, ſome by wicked Men, ſome by wiſe Men ill applied, ſome by good Men ill expreſſed, ſome by falſe Prophets, and yet true; ſome by true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and yet falſe?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> ſetting aſide the Contempt <hi>George Fox, George Whitehead,</hi> and others, anciently threw upon the Scriptures, as <hi>Carnal, Duſt,</hi> the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's Meat, Husk;</hi> not of that Authority with what is ſaid to be ſpoken from the Spirit of Truth, and the like. I ſay, ſetting aſide, <hi>THAT</hi> what can be the natural Tendency of theſe Queries, but to prejudice the weak <hi>Readers</hi> againſt the Authority of the Scriptures; eſpecially ſuch who take Examples of them, in that they never read a <hi>Chapter</hi> in their Meetings for the Worſhip of <hi>GOD.</hi> If what the true Prophets ſpake, be <hi>FALSE?</hi> If what good Men ſpake, be <hi>ILL EXPRESSED?</hi> If what wiſe Men ſpake, be <hi>ILL APPLIED?</hi> Then what is there left, beſides what was ſpoken by true Prophets, good Men, and wiſe Men? If there be any, as you ſeem to ſuggeſt, that 'tis ſpoken by the grand Impoſtor, and by wicked Men, and falſe Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if there be ſome little left that was ſpoken by true Prophets, and is true; ſome by good Men well expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſome by wiſe Men rightly applied: Yet you not having made any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, who ſhall know what is true, from that which is falſe; that which is well expreſſed, and rightly applied, from the contrary, ſince you have left theſe three wretched Queſtions unreſolved, and the Scriptures doubtful, ambiguous, and uncertain, robbing them of that Authority which <hi>GOD's</hi> People from Age to Age have juſtly attributed to them. As for the five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who wrote them, <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Hermes,</hi> is now put into the world as a Queſtion? Yea, whether either or neither be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of thoſe Books? Yea, theſe very Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which I never heard queſtion'd before, are now propoſed, whether <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Hermes</hi> be the Author of them? Now if <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Hermes</hi> be all one, then why is the Query put, unleſs you would have <hi>Moſes</hi> to be <hi>Hermes,</hi> and not <hi>Hermes</hi> to be <hi>Moſes?</hi> And ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> being loſt, and <hi>Hermes</hi> only a Philoſopher in <hi>Egypt</hi> being found, the Books going under the Name of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s, ſhall be loſt alſo. If this was not your mind, why do you fill the world with ſuch Atheiſtical Queries, <hi>&amp;c? Chriſt</hi> himſelf often quoted the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">See Mark 12.16. Luke 16.29. Luke 24.27. Acts 3. Luke 26.27, 44.</note>, and ſo did the Apoſtles. I never, till now, took ſo much notice of this your wretched Deſign, to bring the Scriptures into Contempt, that ſo you might exalt your own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Traditions; and therefore there is Reaſon enough in this to ſhew, <hi>that forſaking the Quakers, is no Apoſtacy from the Chriſtian Faith.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Shews that the Forſaking the <hi>Quakers,</hi> is no Apoſtacy from the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith.</head>
               <p>IN my Book, <hi>One Blow more at</hi> NEW ROME, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I gave ſix Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why I compared the Quakers to <hi>New Rome, Rome</hi>'s <hi>Siſter,</hi> &amp;c. Amongſt which one was, That they value their unwritten Traditions above the Scriptures, five of thoſe ſix <hi>G. W.</hi> never touches: But that of their valuing their unwrit Traditions above the Scriptures, he ſays, is a Lye, without giving any one Demonſtration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore to juſtifie my Charge, <hi>That you value your unwrit Traditions above the Scriptures,</hi> I prove thus: Firſt, it never was from firſt to laſt your practice to read any one Chapter of the Bible, nor any one Epiſtle of <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> or any of the Apoſtles in your Meetings for Worſhip of <hi>GOD;</hi> when as you have read the Epiſtles of <hi>Robert Sandyland, Samuel Cater, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Penn, George Whitehead,</hi> and <hi>Stephen Criſp,</hi> with as much Attention and Devotion as the Papiſts do their Legends; and this, with what is writ in Chap. IV. is ſufficient to prove the Point: for I take all which is written in oppoſition to, or in competition with the Scriptures, to be unwritten Traditions.</p>
               <p>Now if I can make it firſt appear, that it is a principle of the Papiſts not to read the Scriptures in their Churches. And ſecondly, That it was, and is the practice of Proteſtants, to read the Scriptures in their Churches and Aſſemblies, for the Worſhip of <hi>GOD;</hi> then I hope <hi>Geo. Whitehead</hi> will not blame me for calling them <hi>New Rome,</hi> who in almoſt every point follows their Example: And alſo I hope it will be a caution to many of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> to look about them, who ſhall find themſelves, led by their Teachers, into the very Road and High way to <hi>Rome,</hi> before ever they ſo much as thought of it, nay, that they are in her very Borders and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, when they thought all had been well, and that they had been as their Teachers tell them, and would make them believe; even in the Heights of <hi>Sion;</hi> in the Truth, and none but <hi>THEY;</hi> and that amongſt them <hi>ONLY</hi> is God known, elected before the world began; and the like.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Then to ſhew that it was againſt the principles of the Papiſts, to read the Scriptures in their Churches.</p>

                     <hi>ye have brought the People from Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to careleſs Idleneſs; from ſpeaking to God with Hearts and Lips, to a ſpiritual Dumbneſs; from Prayers, to Chapters; from holy Think,</hi> (or ſilent meeting) <hi>to unprofitable Hearing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much from one of the ableſt, the Pope had to defend his Errors by; which the Reader may obſerve, that the Papiſts do account it a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Dumbneſs, and a Device of Satan, and unprofitable to read the Chapters of the Bible in their Churches, and that it prevents their holy thinking; or, to ſpeak in their <hi>Younger Siſters</hi> Language, prevent their <hi>ſilent Meetings;</hi> the Parallel holds good.</p>
                  <p>Now let us hear what the Proteſtants, and ancient Fathers opinion were in that caſe; and the rather too, becauſe I am joined to a Church, which proclaim the reading the Scriptures, and perhaps, it may be one of their reaſons, and none of the leaſt neither, why they call me an Apoſtate; which is the ſecond thing I promiſed to ſpeak to, in order to ſhew, that the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers follow the ſteps of the Papiſts, but will not once caſt an Eye upon the Proteſtant Path in this particular. For though they will not in plain words, call the reading the Scriptures, for worſhip of God, <hi>Advice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, a ſpiritual Dumbneſs, unprofitable Hearing;</hi> and the like. Yet they not reading one Chapter in 20 or 30 years together, in their Religious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies (if ſo I may call them) their Practice ſays Amen to the principles of the Papiſts in that point; as well as beſpeak their averſneſs to the Way, Practice, and Manner of the ancient Fathers, Martyrs and Proteſtants, to this day.

               <p>But ſince King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> came to the Crown (as in the Letter to the Quakers was well obſerved) <hi>NO</hi> Salutation, <hi>NO</hi> Meſſage, <hi>NO</hi> Prayer for nor <hi>NO</hi> Addreſs to K. <hi>W.</hi> and Q. <hi>M.</hi> made Publick, <hi>NO</hi> Book writ in favour of him, <hi>NO</hi> In all Humility, <hi>NO</hi> In all Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, <hi>NO</hi> In all Affection, <hi>NO</hi> Publick Prayers for his long and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Reign, <hi>NO</hi> Laud and Praiſe that his enemies are defeated; here is all <hi>NO, NO, NO, NO:</hi> Tho, thanks be to GOD, he is now ſettled peaceably in his three Kingdoms: <hi>COME</hi> what can you ſay for your ſelves? Are you like thoſe 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.27. <hi>The children of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial, who ſaid, How ſhall this man ſave us? And they deſpiſed him,</hi>

                  <hi>and brought him no preſents,</hi> (no Prayers, no Addreſſes.) I know you have too much eſpouſed the <hi>Romiſh</hi> principles, ſome of which are, 1. <hi>We muſt believe as the Church (i. e.</hi> your Church) <hi>believes.</hi> 2. <hi>That the</hi> (your) <hi>Church cannot err.</hi> 3. <hi>That ſhe hath power to bind and looſe.</hi> 4. <hi>And

               </p>
               <p>Nay, worſe than ſo. And as an aggravation of your Ingratitude, you made an <hi>ORDER</hi> for the calling in the Widow <hi>Whitrow</hi>'s Books, (ſhe being formerly of your Society) which was writ but in favour of this Government, what Scripture had you for that? You ſay, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did not require you to pray for Kings by <hi>Name;</hi> I ſay ſo too: But ſince you prayed for, and addreſſed your ſelves to King <hi>James</hi> by <hi>Name,</hi> why can you not as well pray for Their Majeſties by <hi>Name?</hi> Well, but ſince you can bring the Scriptures to cover and excuſe your not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing, or praying for them by <hi>Name,</hi> where do you find any Text for cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in, and hindering the Sale of the Widow <hi>Whitro'ws</hi> Book aforeſaid? That is the Queſtion, which in your next you are deſired to anſwer. And tho I hope you did not order it to be burned, as I am told, (and that by one of your own People too) that <hi>George Whitehead</hi> ordered my Books to be burnt throughout all his Dominion, I am ſure therein he followed <hi>Rome</hi> exactly. The way is, firſt condemn the Man, then condemn his Books; but firſt burn the Man, then his Books. And ſometimes, when ſhe cannot help it, ſhe do's otherwiſe, and ſo do you; you have firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned me as a <hi>Self-condemned Apoſtate;</hi> next, my Books you have order'd to be burnt. But I have not as yet heard, that you have ordered a Stake to be prepared for me, I do thank <hi>GOD</hi> you cannot; 'tis an old ſaying, <q>'Tis good that curſt Cows have ſhort Horns.</q> You that burn my Books if you had power, which <hi>GOD</hi> grant you never may, I would not truſt you to burn me. I tell you, what thoughts ſoever I had of you in 1686, I have worſe thoughts of you now: And <hi>G. W.</hi> is one principal Man that hath raiſed theſe thoughts. Firſt, By his defaming me, endeavouring to deſtroy my Reputation, according to the <hi>Jeſuits Morals,</hi> and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Practiſes to the <hi>Martyrs</hi> all along. Secondly, By charging me in divers things as a <hi>great Criminal,</hi> where his Conſcience tells him <hi>I am clear</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Particularly his ſecond Charge in his laſt, where he finds no Cauſe.</note>. And Thirdly, That inſtead of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace in the way of Peace, he acts as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereto, as <hi>light</hi> is to <hi>darkneſs.</hi> And tho he writes three Books againſt me in nine Months time, yet he expoſes me <hi>the Contentious Perſon</hi> And thus he goes on, and ſays, <hi>He neither conſults Events, nor fears Effects.</hi> And the People, his Diſciples, love to have it ſo; if they did not, they would not ſuffer ſuch a Make-bate, ſuch a peeviſh, waſpiſh Man, to ſit and ſcrible one Book after another, and yet will not come forth to prove his Accuſation, nor defend his Charge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he and his Brethren ſtand charged. And now, by this my Book, I do hereby challenge four or ſix of their ableſt Preachers to come forth, in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102281:33"/> the vindication of their Twelve Principles in the firſt Chapter if they can, giving me a months notice; and I will, <hi>GOD</hi> permitting, meet them in <hi>Milden-Hall,</hi> and prove them erroneous, and pernicious to the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> As alſo accept of the Three Charges exhibited by <hi>George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> againſt me in his laſt Pamphlet, ſtyled, <hi>The Contentious Apoſtate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, &amp;c.</hi> And this will be better, than everlaſtingly to print. And tho in 1682, you would take no notice of what is ſaid <hi>de Chriſtiana Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi> p. 213. nor in the <hi>Painted Harlot,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 70, 71. Yet if you look therein, you may perceive my then Reſolution, in caſe you proceeded in that baſe and unworthy way in which <hi>S. Cater</hi> began, (tho indeed I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways took <hi>G. W.</hi> to have a hand in that Book.) I ſay I was reſolved to ſpare no Arrow which might light on the skirts of this well-favour'd Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, tho I can ſay I have been ſlow; and if <hi>I</hi> could any way have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with them in the leaſt to have acknowledged their Faults wherein they had done amiſs, it would have abated the edge of my Pen, which has been ſevere upon <hi>G.

               <p>Thus, at preſent, <hi>I</hi> only refer him to his Grandfather's pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice <hi>Pope Leo</hi> X.*. and others, ſee <hi>Fox</hi>'s <hi>Acts and Monuments,</hi>

                     <note n="*" place="margin">See my Book <hi>de Chriſtiana Libertate,</hi> p. 30. to 70. where their Original is ſet forth, and G.

                     <q rend="margSglQuotes">That <hi>F.

                  <p>Thus have <hi>I</hi> quoted Dr. <hi>Robert Barnes,</hi> that innocent Martyr faithfully, without any Forgery, or wronging his Words. And it ſtill ſtands a good Witneſs and firm Teſtimony againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> Impoſitions, and forcing

                     <p>
                        <hi>G. W.</hi> was extreamly pinched, as my Neighbours took ſpecial notice of, who ſaid, it was a Jeſuits trick to confeſs and not ſubſcribe; to make a fair ſhew, and yet keep reſerved: For as I have already obſerved, none pretend to deal more freely than a Jugler, he will ſtrike up his Sleeves, make bare his Arms, open his Hands and Fingers, confeſs in a Corner, and tell you a find tale, but all this is only to beguile you, and to deceive you he is but ſtill ſo much the more a Jugler; for if he had meant as he ſaid, why ſhould he refuſe to ſubſcribe, and to give the beſt ſatisfaction he could, to the Auditors, that he meant ſimply and plainly without Guile, Fraud, or Deceit.</p>
                     <p>And this puts me in mind of <hi>Hungate</hi> the Jeſuit, who diſputing with Dr. <hi>Bramhall,</hi> once Arch-biſhop of <hi>Armagh</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who haſtily ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102281:41"/> (a thing they ſeldom do) but ſoon repented; which being pertinent to my occaſion I ſhall recite, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <q rend="margSglQuotes">One of the ſubjects of the diſputation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſaid Biſhop and the Jeſuit was the Article of Tranſubſtantiation, whence they eaſily ſlided into that other of the half Communion; where he ſhamefully baffled their Doctrine of Concomitancy; and drove the Jeſuit up to ſo narrow a corner, that he affirmed Eating was Drinking, and Drinking was Eating, in a material or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſenſe. Mr. <hi>Bramhall</hi> lookt upon this as ſo Elegant Soleciſm; and that he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no greater Trophy, if he could get it under his Hand, what he declared with his Tongue; which being deſired, was by the other, in his heat and ſhame to ſeem to retract, as readily-granted; but upon cooler thoughts, finding that he could not quench his thirſt with a piece of Bread, he reflected ſo ſadly on the diſhonour he had ſuffered, that not being able to digeſt it, in ten days time he dyed.</q> See the Life of Bp. <hi>Bramhall</hi> in his Works printed in Folio, where you may read the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry more at large. And truly for my part I ſhould have thought it worth my while if I could have got <hi>G. W.</hi> to ſubſcribe with his Hand, what he acknowledged, to one's thinking, with his Tongue; for I knew that both he, <hi>Stephen Criſp,</hi> and <hi>W. Penn</hi> had juſtified the ſame in Print: So that if I could have gotten him to ſubſcribe, their Infallibility would have had a ſore blow; for it was yet never known that they recanted under their hands any error be it never ſo monſtrous and groſs, yet <hi>W. Penn</hi> ſays in their <hi>Judas and the Jews,</hi> p. 8. <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <q rend="margSglQuotes">It has never been my practice to palliate that which cannot be juſtified, &amp;c.</q> By which Expreſſion he ſhould think no practice ſo erroneous and monſtrous but he can juſtifie it, or elſe he would never have gone about to juſtifie <hi>Joſiah Coal</hi>'s Letter to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> with thoſe Idolatrous expreſſions, as he did in the ſaid Book, <hi>p.</hi> 44.</p>
                     <p>But how willing ſoever I was to have had <hi>G.

                     <p>By the Name they give him, <hi>viz.

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Shews that the Forſaking the <hi>Quakers,</hi> is no Apoſtacy from the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith.</head>
               <p>I Am now come to conſider two particular paſſages in <hi>G. W</hi>'s. Book, <hi>The Contentious Apoſtate, and his Blow,</hi> &amp;c. p. 3. <hi>viz.</hi> Fra. Bugg <hi>and his Company being got to the Meeting before</hi> G. W. AND INTO THE <hi>Gallery,</hi> WHERE <hi>our Miniſtring Friends uſed to be,</hi> &amp;c. 2. F. Bugg <hi>premiſing his property as Feoffee in Trust for the Meeting-houſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe two paſſages (with many other) being falſe, renders his Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive a falſe and partial Narration: And if in their former Narratives, as their Tryals at Aſſizes and Seſſions, they have dealt ſo falſly, it is no marvel that the Magiſtrates were brought into ſuch Contempt, as unjuſt Judges, illegal Proceedings, arbitrary and the like; for there is a 100 ready to teſtifie that there was not with me, in the Gallery, one man of my Company, when <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> came into the Meeting; and yet to render me turbulent, ſets forth to the world, that I and my Company were in the Gallery when he came into the Meeting-houſe, which is as falſe as falſe can be: Yea, ſo aſhamed, their own People were of that downright lye, that they blotted it out of the Books they diſperſed hereaway; but that it might go in other places for an Infallible Truth, they did not ſo much as put it in the Errata. I do believe that he hath left out, in <hi>p.</hi> 5, 6, 7. not only words, but half lines, and whole paſſages to make it look like ſomething; and when all is done none but a few of his own Proſelites, and infatuated Diſciples will give credit to it; nay ſome of them have, in my hearing, declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo out of love with it, as that they will not read it; ſo falſe and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous are moſt of his books, that they begin to be burdenſome.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whereas he ſays, as above obſerved, That I premiſed my property as a <hi>Feoffee,</hi> that is altogether falſe too. Upon theſe and ſeveral other notorious Lyes aſſerted, and many material paſſages ſpoken by my ſelf, Mr. <hi>Archer</hi> and others being left out, I wrote to <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> remind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him of his partial Narrative, Forgeries, Lyes, and apparent Perverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and wilful Omiſſions, and in his anſwer touching the word <hi>Feoffee</hi> he thus writes, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="margSglQuotes">If thou didſt not openly mention the word <hi>Feoffee,</hi> I, and others, are miſtaken, which yet I am not convinced of, for I was then ſomething concerned, that thou ſhouldſt be ſo much intereſted in the Meeting-houſe. But I am glad thou ſayſt now thou art no <hi>Feoffee,</hi> wherein then ſtands thy property, legally, as Owner of the Meeting-houſe? If ſo, our <hi>Friends</hi> are much beholden to thee; if not, is it not as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102281:46"/> one intruſt for them, and the uſe intended? Or is it upon thy free and charitable Contributions to the Houſe? If <hi>THAT</hi> was the intention, <hi>IT</hi> will <hi>ADMIT</hi> of other <hi>CONSEQUENCES</hi> than a claim to ſuch a property in the Meeting-houſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now being willing to clear all paſſages of any weight, and conſidering that this may come out in his next, I ſhall ſpeak fully to it; and grant, firſt, That I am no Feoffee; ſecondly, I am not owner of the Meeting-houſe; nor thirdly, As one in truſt for them and the uſe intended: But fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, As a free Contributer to the houſe I own my ſelf to have a property. Well, <hi>G. W.</hi> but this thou ſayſt will admit of other Conſequences than a claim, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yes <hi>George</hi> I was not unſenſible of it: And that though Mr. <hi>Pennyman</hi> and others have had properties, by being Contributers to the purchaſing, building and repaiting of Meeting-houſes; yet, when they have oppoſed your errors, then you have denied them the uſe they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had: And therefore I knowing your Injuſtice in this point, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding your ſeeming Innocency, I took care in time to prevent the other <hi>CONSEQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ENCES</hi> you mention, <hi>viz.</hi> to be turned out of all right, priviledge and advantage, tho I was at the fourth part of the charge of the Houſe and Burying-ground; for I having the Original Deeds in my hands, the Feoffees upon a time deſired me to deliver up the ſaid Deeds to them; but I anſwered, No; I have a property in the houſe, and until you ſecure that to me and my Heirs, I will deliver no Deeds So then it reſted a while, and ſoon after I had a Letter from their Lawyer, an Abſtract whereof followeth.</p>

                     <p>Reader, who ever thou art, examin thy own heart, and try thy own Faith by the Holy Scriptures; and if thou doſt not believe theſe few Articles, then queſtion thy Condition: And if thou beeſt one called a <hi>Quaker</hi> of the <hi>FOXONIAN PARTY,</hi> and of long ſtanding, and ſhalt ſay in thy heart, As for theſe People they are ſeparated from us, they are Apoſtates, they hold dangerous Opinions; and as for theſe Principles I am wholly a ſtranger to them, having never heard ſuch Doctrine in all our Books: For they teach Perfection attainable in this life, <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaid he wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed it. They teach that the Scripture is not a Rule to walk by. They do not teach to believe Juſtification only and alone through the merits of Chriſt's Death and Paſſion. They do not believe the Reſurrection of the Body as here ſet down. If any of them tell thee otherwiſe, and ſay they do, believe them not, until they put forth a Book in Print ſignifying the ſame: For they have given grounds of Suſpition that they have erred from the Faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore believe them not, until they give publick Satisfaction to the World of what they hold concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> eſpecially of theſe Points rehearſed, wherein they are thought to be moſt defective, and that from the words of their own Principles.</p>
                     <p>And if thou art one of the <hi>Storian Party,</hi> which, for diſtinction ſake, I ſo term it: For I had an honourable Eſteem of <hi>John Story,</hi> and believe he is at Reſt, and that he was a deep Sufferer by <hi>G. F.</hi> and his Party, and that he never held the Errors which I have herein reproved; nay, not one of them that I ever underſtood. Yet, I ſay, examin thy ſelf, I refer thee to the aforeſaid Book, which, in the main, is very ſound; and in the Cloſe thereof, methinks I perceive the very frame and temper of the Martyrs: And wherever I find that low, meek, and ſelf-abaſing temper of mind, and frame of ſpirit, in what Society of Chriſtian people ſoever, <hi>I</hi> am affected

               <p>SInce I writ the foregoing Treatiſe, I have ſeen <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s Book, <hi>Antichrist in Fleſh <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmasked,</hi> &amp;c. in Anſwer to a Book, <hi>Antichrist in Spirit <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmasked:</hi> Or, <hi>Quakeriſm a Great Deluſion,</hi> &amp;c. wherein <hi>G.

And had I a good ground to believe what he therein ſets forth, (in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Name) to be really ſo indeed, I would ſtop the Publication of what I have at this time writ againſt their Errors: But until they by ſome Publick and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Act, firſt Renounce and Condemn, under the Hands of ſome of their principal Leaders and Teachers, their manifeſt Errors laid down in Print, and hitherto owned by them, a few whereof I have herein related, I have no reaſon to believe that they mean as they ſay; but, like deceitful Workers, they transform themſelves into the likeneſs of what they really are not; that is to ſay, into the likeneſs of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and true Profeſſors of the ancient Faith; and thereby deceive the ſimple with their feigned words and jugling tricks, who, like our Enemies at Sea, either to defend themſelves from our ſtroke, or to draw us into their ſnare, will put up the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Flag: So theſe now make a ſhew of their owning the Scriptures to be <hi>Holy,</hi> (which formerly they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently call'd <hi>CARNAL LETTER</hi>

                     <hi>See their Paper ſtiled,</hi> The Chriſtianity of the People commonly called <hi>Quakers,</hi> &amp;c.</note>: But when I look into their former printed Books, and eſpecially their Epiſtles, which they frequently ſent to their Friends to be read in their Church Aſſemblies, there is not a word of any ſuch Confeſſion; ſo that what <hi>G. W.</hi> hath now writ, is but like the <hi>French</hi> Men when they put up the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Flag, merely a Trick and Sham, and ought not to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any otherwiſe than as ſuch.</p>
               <p>And therefore to make this evidently appear, I may firſt recite part of <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s Book aforeſaid; and ſecondly, two or three Paſſages out of one of their Epiſtles wrote by two of the moſt

                  <p>By which the Reader will eaſily perceive, that what <hi>G. W.</hi> hath lately wrote by way of Confeſſion, and in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Name, is only to amuſe his Reader, and delude the World: For in the whole Epiſtle, containing 23 pages in Quarto, there is not a word which ſets forth the Scripture to be profitable for Doctrine; not a word by way of Confeſſion of Sins to <hi>GOD,</hi> or asking Pardon for Chriſt's ſake; not a word about their owning or valuing the Incarnation of our bleſſed Saviour, his Sufferings, Death, Reſurrection, or Aſcenſion; not a word of their hopes of being ſaved through the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs and Merits, (as <hi>G.

                  <p>Thirdly, I ſhall make ſome Obſervations or Animadverſions upon the ſaid Epiſtles, in order to ſhew the Fallacy of the ſeeming ſerious Confeſſion of <hi>G.

                     <p>Now this, with much more, <hi>G. W.</hi> in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Name, ſeems with much ſeriouſneſs to avouch; ſo that had they firſt by ſome manifeſt Act under the hand of ſix or more of their principal Leaders, condemned their former Errors, which are laid down in Print, and as contrary to this Confeſſion of <hi>G. W</hi>'s, as Light is to Darkneſs, I ſhould have thought that there had been a great Reformation in them, and ſhould have been glad thereof: But until they firſt condemn what they have given forth in Print as their Principles, and that as they have ſaid by the eternal Spirit of <hi>GOD,</hi> I, nor any Man elſe have any ground to believe that <hi>G.

For as it was our frequent practice to read the Epiſtles of <hi>G. Fox, Steph.

And, as I have elſewhere herein ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, make them believe that they are got into the Holy Land, even ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Canaan,</hi> when indeed they are but in the Borders of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>OLD ROME,</hi> think themſelves rich, full, wanting nothing; when they are poor, blind, miſerable, and want all things, through their miſtaken Zeal, and following the Dictates of their blind Guides; who, inſtead of ſetting forth the ſolid Principles of Religion, have ſo leavened them into their Phariſaical lump, that they have erred concerning the Faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who was born of the Virgin, who ſuffered, was dead, and buried, who roſe again the third day, and aſcended up into Heaven above<note n="*" place="margin">This <hi>G.

But alas! All this, and much more in this recited Epiſtle of theirs, as well as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102281:69"/> divers others of their Writings, is wholly inverted, neither believed nor expected, I write it with ſorrow of heart, <hi>GOD</hi> knows it: For as they ſay <hi>Christ is within them,</hi> which, in a Scripture ſenſe may be allowed; ſo they hold his Crucifixion is within, his Sufferings within, the Reſurrection within<note n="*" place="margin">Out of the Grave of Sin, this, I think, is all the Reſurrection they underſtand.</note>, Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper within, Miracles within; the Dead are raiſed within<note n="†" place="margin">See this your Epiſtle, p. 7. 17.</note>, they looſe out of Priſon within, caſt in their Nets within, divide the Fiſh within, thruſt in the Sickle within; they bind the Tares in Bundles within.

Thus have they torn the Scriptures in pieces, and changed the ſolid Truths and fundamental Principles of the Goſpel, into meer Allegories and myſtical Enthuſiaſms. And therefore until they retract and condemn their ancient Errors laid down in their printed Books as their Principles, and other their wild and extravagant Notions, Dreams and Whimſies, they are not to be taken to be in good earneſt, or to be ſincere in what they <hi>(for ſome ends best known to themſelves)</hi> ſhall ſay in any new deceitful Confeſſion of Faith.</p>
